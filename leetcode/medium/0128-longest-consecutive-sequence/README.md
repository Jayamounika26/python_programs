# Longest Consecutive Sequence

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return  *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.* 

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= nums.length <= 105
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

```py
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        num_set = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for num in num_set:
            # only start counting if num is the start of a sequence
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                current = num
                streak = 1

                while current + 1 in num_set:
                    current += 1
                    streak += 1

                longest = max(longest, streak)

        return longest
```
