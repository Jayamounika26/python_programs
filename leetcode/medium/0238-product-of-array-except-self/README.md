# Product of Array Except Self

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums`, return  *an array*  `answer`  *such that*  `answer[i]`  *is equal to the product of all the elements of*  `nums`  *except*  `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is  **guaranteed**  to fit in a  **32-bit**  integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= nums.length <= 105
- -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
- The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

 

 **Follow up:**  Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array  **does not**  count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        n = len(nums)
        ans = [1] * n

        prefix = 1
        for i in range(n):
            ans[i] = prefix
            prefix *= nums[i]

        suffix = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            ans[i] *= suffix
            suffix *= nums[i]

        return ans
```
